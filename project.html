<h2>1.Design and Analyze Wearable microstrip patch antenna with different flexible substrate for health monitoring system</h2>
    <p>
        Design and analyze of wearable U- slot rectangular microstrip patch antenna (RMSA) using high frequency structure
        simulator (HFSS) and analyze their performance with different flexible substrate.

<h2>2.Detection of  Malware using ML technique-A Hybrid Approach</h2>
    <p>
        The main objective of the paper, to 
        train the dataset with the algorithms such as k-Nearest 
        Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest and 
        the hybrid model. Hence, the project primarily focusses
         on detection of malware in the dataset and compare 
         the accuracy of the algorithm.
